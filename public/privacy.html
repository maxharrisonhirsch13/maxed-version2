<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 5, 2026</p>

<p>Maxed ("we", "our", "us") operates the Maxed fitness application. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Name, email address, and profile details you provide during registration.</li>
<li><strong>Fitness Data:</strong> Workout history, exercise preferences, training splits, and performance data you log in the app.</li>
<li><strong>Wearable Device Data:</strong> When you connect third-party services (such as WHOOP, Garmin, or other fitness platforms), we collect health and fitness metrics including recovery scores, heart rate, sleep data, strain, stress levels, and body battery readings.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic app usage patterns to improve the experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To provide personalized workout suggestions and readiness assessments.</li>
<li>To display your fitness metrics, progress, and training history.</li>
<li>To generate AI-powered coaching insights based on your workout history and wearable data.</li>
<li>To improve and maintain the application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Integrations</h2>
<p>When you connect wearable devices or fitness platforms (e.g., WHOOP, Garmin Connect), we access data through their official APIs with your explicit authorization. You can disconnect these integrations at any time through the App Integrations page, which will delete the associated tokens and synced data from our systems.</p>

<h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase (hosted on AWS) with row-level security policies. Authentication tokens for third-party services are encrypted and stored separately from your profile data. We use HTTPS for all data transmission.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share anonymized, aggregated data for analytics purposes. Your workout and health data is never shared with other users unless you explicitly enable sharing through privacy settings.</p>

<h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>You can delete your account and all associated data at any time. When you disconnect a wearable integration, all tokens and synced data for that service are immediately deleted. Upon account deletion, all personal data is permanently removed from our systems.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access, update, or delete your personal data at any time.</li>
<li>Disconnect third-party integrations and have associated data removed.</li>
<li>Control what fitness data is shared with friends via privacy settings.</li>
<li>Request a copy of your data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Maxed is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
